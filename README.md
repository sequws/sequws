    👋 Hi, I’m @sequws
    👀 I’m interested in software development.
    🌱 I’m currently trying to switch from desktop programming to the web.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.

This is my new repository where I will share all my new after-work projects.

Most of my old projects I hosted on my private server. 
Almost all of them are desktop applications for specific audience. 
Some of them are described on the page: http://www.projekty.sequ.pl
